                Nestled on a hillside just outside the UNESCO World Heritage city know as a "living museum of Nepal history," the Bhaktapur Annapurna is a unique and luxurious refuge just outside urban Kathmandu. 
                 <br>
                     Each of the hotel's extra-large bedrooms have picture windows that afford spectacular views of the Himalayan peaks and the idyllic countryside. Completed in 2015, the hotel's Newari style architecture and furnishings provide guests a wonderful combination of traditional design and comfortable luxury. 
                     <br>
                     Within just a few minutes' drive or 15 minute walk lies all the treasures of Bhaktapur's rich heritage including Durbar Square and Nyatopola Temple. Also within a few minutes' walk is the ancient SuryaBinayak Temple, and beautiful Gundu valley where guests can enjoy peaceful village walks in one of the most renowned rhododendron forests in Nepal.
